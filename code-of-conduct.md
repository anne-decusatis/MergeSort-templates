MergeSort NYC Code of Conduct (long version, v1; June 2015)


**(i) REPORTING VIOLATIONS:**


Any member has the authority to remove violators of our Code of Conduct from our spaces.


Ultimately, the person responsible for addressing Code of Conduct violations is Anne DeCusatis, co-founder and organizer of the Meetup group (as of 6/2015)
She can be reached via Meetup message, or via email at mergesortnyc@gmail.com.
If you do not feel comfortable going to Anne, any member of our leadership team would be happy to address any problems you have with code of conduct violators. We can be found at:

**(ii) CODE OF CONDUCT:**


We expect everyone involved in the MergeSort community to follow this code of conduct. This applies to all of our methods of communication.


We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form. Sexual language and imagery should only be used for women-positive purposes in accordance with best practices advocated by professional sex educators (if you’re not sure what those are, don’t do it). People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the space or the event at the discretion of any member.


We do not seek to list all cases of unacceptable behavior, but provide examples to help guide our community in thinking through how to respond when we experience these types of behavior, whether directed at ourselves or others.
If you are unsure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn’t. Each person you interact with can define where that line is for them. Impact matters more than intent. Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your responsibility. Problems happen when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm or ok with everyone. This is particularly problematic when we are in a position of power or privilege.


People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Any behavior or action experienced as harassment will be responded to as such.




**(iii) EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive list):**


Here are a few examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Negative or offensive remarks based on the protected classes of race, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation **as well as** gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, or clothing. **Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.**
- Touching people without their affirmative consent.
- Sustained and negative disruption of meetings or talks.
- Patronizing language or behavior.
- Aggressive and micro-aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism, providing corrections that do not improve the conversation (sometimes referred to as "well actually"s), repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic, or subtle prejudice (for example, comments like “That’s so easy my grandmother could do it.”).
- Referring to people in a way that misidentifies their gender and/or rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).
- Retaliating against anyone who files a formal complaint that someone has violated these codes or laws.
