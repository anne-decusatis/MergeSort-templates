Hi! It's great that you want to be an ally to women in tech! Right now MergeSort events are only for people who themselves identify as women or as nonbinary. To help create a safe space, we can only accept membership requests from people who meet that criteria. If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to mergesortnyc@gmail.com.
