**Open Hack [[time of day]] at [[name of location]]**

(Optional: Any important changes e.g. last-minute venue change, maybe in all caps)

Bring a project that you want to work on, if you have one - if not, come to see what other people are interested in doing and making! Software, knitting, papercraft, vidding, zinemaking, sewing, hardware, etc. are all welcome.

(Optional: fun details specific to this meetup)

Accessibility: [[Location of gender-neutral restrooms]] [[Info about stairs/elevators at venue]]

(Example: Accessibility: We will be rebranding the restrooms as gender-inclusive; please let us know if you encounter any problems with this. There is an elevator, so no climbing stairs is necessary.)

Note: We are a space for nonbinary people and women (trans and gender nonconforming inclusive), if you identify as male please get in contact with the organizers before showing up.

(Optional: Note 2: Anything else that's important to know but not urgent - e.g. venue's code of conduct)

Remember to check the box on Meetup.com to hide venue information from non-members - I belive the text is something like "show venue information only to members"
If space is limited at the venue, remember to set an RSVP limit.
