Dear friends,

It is long past time to admit that, due to many changes in my life and in the world, I will be unable to schedule anything new for MergeSort in the foreseeable future. As such, I will be closing this Meetup group. (For those on it, I will leave the Slack open for a little while longer to share contact information but it is my intent to shut it down in the near future as well.)

The community I found here meant so much to me when I was just getting started in New York, and I am so grateful for the times we had together and the ways in which I could grow from them. Thank you for being a part of it with me. I would especially like to thank Sumana Harihareswara, for too many things to count, from joining me at the first Maker Faire we attended in 2015 to https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/ at the end.

I encourage others with interest to start their own local gatherings for making (for potentially virtual values of 'local' in these times). I have collected the resources I used when making MergeSort at https://github.com/anne-decusatis/MergeSort-templates, please feel free to take what is useful or ask me to add things that are missing.

If you'd like to contact me directly about this, please do so via email at (redacted).

Best wishes, and thank you again,

Anne
